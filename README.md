##### Strip ANSI color codes

Basically ripped from [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7149601/how-to-remove-replace-ansi-color-codes-from-a-string-in-javascript).

If you find yourself in a situation where you're streaming a colored repl somewhere else, such as a browser, you can use this module to escape the terminal ansi colors.
